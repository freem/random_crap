random_crap
===========
you need more description than the repository name??

This repository is host to a bunch of random crap I've made. This random crap
usually doesn't deserve its own repository, so if you're looking for something
else I've made that isn't random crap, please see [my github](https://github.com/freem).

Descriptions
------------
* ```gex_randwep``` - Small Lua script for selecting Random weapons for Goldeneye X (and two databases)
* ```f_datetime.lua``` - No, not every system has a decent ```date``` executable. Really hacky thing I use for generating dates to be included in binary files or whatever.
* ```packbits.lua``` - Packbits file encoder/decoder
